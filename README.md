# User Experience UX

## Initial Assessment and Evaluation

BIO CWT is a family business established in 1972 with a passion for wood and has been in business for over 50 years. They are based in the heart of England and supply a wide range of solid wood products across the UK mainland.
They have a large customer base that requires quick and easy access to product information.

## Essential information for the landing page

* A unique selling proposition
* A hero images
* The benefits of their offering
* Some form of social proof
* A single conversion goal or call to action


## User Stories

User stories always fit the INVEST set of criteria by Bill Wake and acceptance criteria.
<br/>
Independent – they can be developed in any sequence and changes to one User Story don’t affect the others.
<br/>
Negotiable – it’s up to the team to decide how to implement them; there is no rigidly fixed workflow.
<br/>
Valuable – each User Story delivers a detached unit of value to end users.
<br/>
Estimable – it’s quite easy to guess how much time the development of a User Story will take.
<br/>
Small – it should go through the whole cycle (designing, coding, testing) during one sprint.
<br/>
Testable – there should be clear acceptance criteria to check whether a User Story is implemented appropriately.

As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]

# Tech Stack

## Languages
* HTML5
* CSS
## Frameworks, Software and Pre-processors
* Bootstrap 5 - As a developer I used Bootstrap because it is flexible and easy to use. Its main advantages are responsive design, wide browser compatibility, consistent design through the use of reusable components, and ease of use and quick learning.
* SaSS - SaSS is an extension of CSS that allows you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps organise things and allows you to create stylesheets faster. And I've decided to use SaSS through out this project.
* Figma - Figma is a powerful design tool that helped me create the logo and design for this website. Figma is a web-based design tool with real-time collaboration. It works in web browsers and there are also native apps that you can work with offline.
